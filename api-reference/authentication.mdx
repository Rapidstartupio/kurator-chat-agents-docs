The Authentication `Bearer` token is a widely used method for securing API requests and authorizing access to protected resources. This token-based authentication mechanism involves the client sending a token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request.

In this documentation, we will provide detailed information on how to generate, validate, and utilize Bearer tokens for authentication purposes. You will learn about the token acquisition process, token formats, and the necessary steps to secure your API endpoints using Bearer tokens.

Provide a `Authorization` header containing your `token`.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <your_token>'
```

## API Tokens

You can get your `Bearer` token by using the `auth` endpoints in the API.
The `agents/<agent_id>/predict` endpoint requiures a separate Authorization header.
